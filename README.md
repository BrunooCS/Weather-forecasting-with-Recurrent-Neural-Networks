3. **Model Definitions**
   - **Dense Neural Network (DNN)**: A simple fully connected network.
   - **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) + Dense**: Combines convolutional layers with dense layers for feature extraction and prediction.
   - **LSTM**: Long Short-Term Memory network for capturing temporal dependencies in sequential data.
   - **GRU**: Gated Recurrent Unit, a simpler alternative to LSTM with similar performance.
   - **Attention LSTM**: LSTM with an attention mechanism to focus on important time steps.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation**
   - Training each model on the preprocessed weather data.
   - Evaluation of models using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE).
   - Visualization of training history and prediction results.
